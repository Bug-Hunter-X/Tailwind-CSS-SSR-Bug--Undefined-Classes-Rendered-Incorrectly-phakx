The solution involves ensuring that all used Tailwind classes are defined in your `tailwind.config.js` file. For custom colors, add them to the `theme` section, or for custom classes, make sure they're included in the `content` array. Using JIT mode will generally resolve this issue. Here's an example of updating `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [ "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",], // Add this if not using JIT mode
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'custom-blue': '#007bff',
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

If using JIT mode, ensure that JIT mode is properly configured in your `tailwind.config.js` and that all your files using Tailwind classes are correctly pointed out in the `content` array.
