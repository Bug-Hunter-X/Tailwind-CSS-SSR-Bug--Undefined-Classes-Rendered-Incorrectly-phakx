This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js that uses server-side rendering (SSR). The problem arises when a Tailwind CSS class is used that is not defined in the `tailwind.config.js` file or the JIT mode is not configured correctly. This results in the class being rendered in the HTML as-is, without being compiled by Tailwind, causing unexpected styling issues.  For example, using `class="bg-custom-blue"` where `bg-custom-blue` is not defined in your configuration will render literally as `bg-custom-blue` in the HTML instead of the associated color.
